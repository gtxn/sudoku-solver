# sudoku-solver
Using a recursion to backtrack steps, it solves any sudoku puzzle! GUI was made with pygameðŸ‘¾ Navigate with arrow keys and press the relevant numbers for each square. A selected square is highlighted in red. After the board is complete, press 'solve' and viola! ðŸŽ‰ (if the sudoku board is unsolvable there is no feedback yet... im working on it wheee)

To test code, run app.py (if pygame is installed)
